          BarberX is located in California’s best kept secret, in a wonderfully
          charming small square hidden between Beauty and Handsome Street in the
          exclusive Rosa Lane. Rosa Lane itself is named after the infamous fair
          that took place on the site that is now known as Rosa Market. It was
          developed in by a Famous Rosa. It comprises of a number of small side
          streets with a variety of boutique shops, restaurants and impressive
          pubs.

          This is where John Smith decided would be the ideal place for his
          barber shop. The BarberX was opened by John in 2015 which he continued
          to run everyday since.

          John was well respected within the local community. Whilst running the
          barber shop, John also worked in the exclusive white’s gentlemen’s
          club in California, where he was proudly elected head barber
          socialising and working alongside some of California’s most
          influential people. He was famous for his warmth and down to earth
          personality.

          John’s dear friend and colleague, Trevor West has continued with his
          legacy and with her amazing team, who are very experienced in all
          aspects of barbering from classic to modern cuts and shaves, the place
          retains the warmth and friendliness that The BarberX has always been
          prized for.
